Mall Customer Segmentation

This project provides an automated Python script to clean and validate the ‘shopping mall Customer Segmentation Dataset’. It checks for data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, outliers, and invalid data types — and outputs a cleaned dataset ready for analysis or machine learning.

Dataset Overview
The dataset typically contains the following columns:
•	`CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
•	`Gender`: Categorical variable (Male/Female)
•	`Age`: Integer (years)
•	`Annual Income `: Customer's annual income in thousands
•	`Spending Score `: Customer’s spending behavior score

Features of the Cleaning Script
	Checks for missing values
	Removes duplicate entries
	Validates column data types
	Identifies and displays outliers (using Box plot )
	Detects invalid or inconsistent data entries
	Calculates and displays correlation matrix
	Saves cleaned data to CSV (`Shopping Mall Customer Segmentation Data_cleaned.csv`)

Requirements
Done using Google Colab via Python
